I'm a data scientist and software developer.
I started out in science, but now I'm more interested in building things.
My scientific research was about emergent phenomena in complex social systems.
That still fascinates me, but I don't just want to describe it, I want to design systems that display constructive emergent effects.

Most recently, I've worked as a data scientist, but most of what I was doing is fullstack development since at a small company, there is not enough people to have a long overhead of "I make the concept, you build it".
So for most of the products we designed, I worked on them with the other software engineers at Fabit.

My hobbies are bouldering, Toastmasters, hacking, and I work on Social Protocols, an open source project/org which has the goal of designing algorithms for social media that direct attention in a way that does not reproduce the distructive patterns of today's engagement-driven recommender systems.

Finally, I'm also a Linux user and like tinkering with my setup.
If you're interested in how I setup my computer, here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/JohannesNakayama/dotfiles).
Currently, I run NixOS and I'm pretty happy with it.
