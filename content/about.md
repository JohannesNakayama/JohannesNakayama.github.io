I'm a data scientist and software developer.
I started my career in science pursueing a PhD at the Human-Computer Interaction Center at RWTH Aachen University.
I researched emergent phenomena in complex social systems, mainly in the field of opinion dynamics, using agent-based modeling.
I'm still passionate about this topic today and pursue it actively in my spare time.

Even though I enjoyed research a lot, I realized that I want to build things rather than only do research and write about stuff.
This is why I switched to industry.
Most recently, I've worked as a data scientist at Fabit GmbH, working on a mobile app with the purpose to help people become financially healthy.
I worked on the frontend (Dart/Flutter), backend (Kotlin/Spring), and the database (PostgreSQL).

### How I work

I'm a passionate Linux user.
Currently, I run NixOS and I'm pretty happy with it.
If you're interested in how I setup my computer, here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/JohannesNakayama/dotfiles).
