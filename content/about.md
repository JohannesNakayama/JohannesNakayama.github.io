I'm a data scientist and software developer.
I started my career in science as a researcher at the Human-Computer Interaction Center at RWTH Aachen University.
My research focus was on emergent phenomena in complex social systems, mainly in the field of opinion dynamics, using agent-based modeling.

Even though I enjoyed research a lot, I realized that I want to build things rather than only do research and write about stuff.
This is why I switched to industry.
Most recently, I've worked as a data scientist at Fabit GmbH, working on a mobile app with the purpose of helping people become financially healthy.
I worked on the frontend (Dart/Flutter), backend (Kotlin/Spring), and the database (PostgreSQL).
