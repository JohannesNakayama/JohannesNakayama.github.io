Hi, I'm Johannes ✌️

I'm a data scientist and software developer.
Worked in science for several years trying to understand the emergence of polarization as a consequence of opinion dynamics in online social networks.
Switched from academia to industry and joined Berlin-based fintech startup Fabit where I worked as a data scientist, mostly doing fullstack development (mobile, backend, database).
In January 2024, along with two co-founders, I decided to go all-in with [Social Protocols](https://social-protocols.org/) to build technology for more intelligent and constructive public conversations.
