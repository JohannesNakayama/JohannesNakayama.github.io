### 2022 Aug - now: Fabit GmbH

**Data Scientist**

Fabit's mission is to help people become financially healthy.
Our main product is a personal finance app that allows users to keep track of their expenses and budget their money.
We focus specifically on helping people out of financially dire situations, for example if they have a lot of debt.
I work at Fabit as a data scientist.
Most of my work consists of working on the product in the frontend (Dart/Flutter), backend (Spring/Kotlin), and on the database (PostgreSQL).
Apart from that, I built a semi-automated reporting infrastructure, analyze the company's data, and communicate my results via interactive visualizations and dashboards.
For data analyses, I used R (mainly a tidyverse stack and shiny for interactive visualizations and dashboards).


### 2021 Feb - 2022 Jul: Human-Computer Interaction Center (RWTH Aachen University)

**Research Assistant**

At RWTH Aachen University I researched emergent phenomena in social systems, using agent-based modeling, tools from network science and graph theory.
I focussed especially on online social and collaborative software, mainly in the field of opinion dynamics.
Apart from that, I did some research on information and data visualization.
A list of research papers I co-authored is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UJHPeoUAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao).


### 2019 May - 2019 Aug: Optinoo GmbH

**Data Science Intern**

As an intern at Optinoo GmbH, I helped develop a matching algorithm to find best matches between job candidates and companies on the basis of culture fit.


### 2018 Feb - 2021 Feb: Human-Computer Interaction Center (RWTH Aachen University)

**Student Assistant Researcher**

In my work as a student assistant researcher, I worked with the junior research group "Digitale MÃ¼ndigkeit" (loosely translates to "digital citizenship").
My work there consisted of building agent-based models, creating publication-ready and interactive data visualizations and statistical analyses, and building scientific software.
