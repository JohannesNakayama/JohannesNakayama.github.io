### 2022 Aug - now: Fabit GmbH

**Data Scientist**

Fabit's mission was to help people become financially healthy.
Our main product was a personal finance app that allowed users to keep track of their 
expenses and budget their money.
We had a specific focus on helping people out of financially dire situations, for example if they had a lot of debt.
I worked at Fabit as a data scientist.
Most of my work consested of working on the product in the frontend (Dart/Flutter), backend (Spring/Kotlin), and on the database (PostgreSQL).
Apart from that, I analyzed the company's data, building a semi-automated reporting infrastructure and interactive data visualizations. 
For data analyses, I used R (mainly a tidyverse stack and shiny for interactive visualizations and dashboards).

- recommender system for next action to improve financial situation
- automated budgeting algorithm


### 2021 Feb - 2022 Jul: Human-Computer Interaction Center (RWTH Aachen University)

**Research Assistant**

* research on emergent phenomena in social systems, especially in online social and collaborative software, network science, agent-based modeling, data visualization, opinion dynamics
* building a graph plot library component for seminr [TODO: link]
* teaching materials for agent-based modeling and complex systems


### 2019 May - 2019 Aug: Optinoo GmbH

**Data Science Intern**

As an intern at Optinoo GmbH, I helped developing a matching algorithm that aimed at finding best matches between job candidates and companies on the basis of culture fit.


### 2018 Feb - 2021 Feb: Human-Computer Interaction Center (RWTH Aachen University)

**Student Assistant Researcher**

In my work as a student assistant researcher, I worked with the junior research group "Digitale MÃ¼ndigkeit" (loosely translates to "digital citizenship").
My work there consisted of building agent-based models, creating publication-ready and interactive data visualizations and statistical analyses, and building scientific software.

As part of my work, I participated in the EuroCSS dataset challenge in 2018 where the task was to determine the level of personalization in a dataset of donated Google search result lists of thousands of participants. 
For this purpose, we developed a novel clustering algorithm, a variation of the K-means algorithm with the rank-biased overlap as metric.

I also co-wrote a graph plotting library for the [seminr](https://github.com/sem-in-r/seminr) library which provides functionality to build structural equation models (SEMs) in R.
