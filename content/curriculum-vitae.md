### 2018 Feb - 2021 Feb

**Student Assistant Researcher at Chair for Communication Science and Human-Computer Interaction Center at RWTH Aachen University**

In my work as a student assistant researcher, I worked in a junior research group called "Digitale MÃ¼ndigkeit" (translates loosely to "digital citizenship").
My tasks there included building agent-based models, creating publication-ready and interactive data visualizations and statistical analyses, and building scientific software.
As part of my work there, I participated in the EuroCSS dataset challenge in 2018 where we analysed a large collection of Google search result pages with regard to personalization.
I also co-wrote a graph plotting library for the [seminr](https://github.com/sem-in-r/seminr) library which provides functionality to build structural equation models (SEMs) in R.
