I co-wrote a plotting module for the popular R library [`seminr`](https://github.com/sem-in-r/seminr) which implements structural equation modeling (SEM).
Representing SEMs as directed graphs make them more accessible for explanation and easier to reason about.
The tool we built provides quick access to a graphical representation of a SEM and it is able to produce publication-ready visualizations as well.
