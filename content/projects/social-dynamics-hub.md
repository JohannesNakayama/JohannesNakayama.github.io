Researching social dynamics, opinion dynamics, and agent-based modeling in my time at RWTH Aachen University, I wrote a lot of introductory material on those topic, which we turned into online learning resources.
I built an educational R library ([`gridabm`](https://github.com/socialdynamicshub/gridabm)) to build and animate grid agent-based models in a few lines of code and wrote [lots of explanations](https://socialdynamicshub.github.io/) on cellular automata, agent-based modeling, emergent phenomena in complex social systems, and other related topics.
The site is open source and contribution is encouraged (see the [publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-35748-0_27)).
All code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/socialdynamicshub).
